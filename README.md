# EstateFlow — Full-Stack Property Platform

EstateFlow is a full-stack real estate application that enables users to discover, explore, and manage property listings through an integrated web platform. It combines map-based navigation, structured listing data, and user-driven actions such as saving properties and creating listings.

## Demo

🎥 **2-minute walkthrough:** *(Add your Drive link here)*

This video covers:

- Property discovery (grid + map)
- Listing details
- Favorites system
- Listing creation flow
- System overview

---

## Problem & Motivation

Real estate platforms are often fragmented across discovery, mapping, and user interaction layers. Users switch between tools to browse listings, view locations, and manage saved properties.

EstateFlow consolidates these into a single platform:

- Centralized listing discovery
- Map-integrated navigation
- User-managed listings and favorites

---

## Key Features

- Property browsing with filters (price, type, location)
- Map-based exploration using geolocation
- Detailed listing pages with images and metadata
- Favorites system for saving listings
- Create / update / delete listings (authenticated users)
- Loan application system
- Contact and location interface
- RESTful backend with JWT authentication

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a typical MERN architecture with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and database layers.

```mermaid

    U[User] --> F[React Frontend]
    F -->|HTTP Requests| B[Express API]
    B --> D[(MongoDB)]

    subgraph API_Details[Express API Internals]
        A[Auth Middleware - JWT]
        R[API Routes - Listings, Favorites, Loans]
        M[File Upload - Multer]
    end

    F --> R
    R --> A
    R --> M
    R --> D
```

## Core User Flows

### Property Discovery

User browses listings → applies filters → switches to map → selects property

---

### Create Listing Flow

1. User fills listing form
2. Images uploaded via Multer
3. Backend validates input
4. Data stored in MongoDB
5. Listing becomes available in feed

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend (React)
    participant A as API (Express)
    participant M as Multer
    participant C as Listing Controller
    participant DB as MongoDB

    U->>F: Fill form and click Publish
    F->>A: POST /api/listings (FormData + JWT)
    A->>M: Process image upload
    M-->>A: Uploaded file metadata
    A->>C: Pass request to controller
    C->>C: Validate input data
    C->>DB: Save listing document
    DB-->>C: Listing saved
    C-->>A: Success response payload
    A-->>F: 201 Created + listing data
    F-->>U: Show new listing in feed/detail
```

---

### Favorites Flow

1. User clicks “Save”
2. API stores relation (user ↔ listing)
3. Favorites page reflects saved data

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend (React)
    participant A as API (Express)
    participant DB as MongoDB

    U->>F: Click Save / Unsave on listing
    alt Add favorite
        F->>A: POST /api/favorites/:listingId
        A->>DB: Insert favorite (userId, listingId)
        DB-->>A: Insert success
        A-->>F: Favorite added
    else Remove favorite
        F->>A: DELETE /api/favorites/:listingId
        A->>DB: Delete favorite (userId, listingId)
        DB-->>A: Delete success
        A-->>F: Favorite removed
    end

    F->>A: GET /api/favorites
    A->>DB: Fetch favorites for user
    DB-->>A: Favorite listings
    A-->>F: Favorites payload
    F-->>U: Render updated favorites page
```
